Latest Build
========

Test builds are ALPHA code quality and really should only be used for testing purposes. 

Install rainmeter and close it, run the app in this folder (or replace your rainmeter exe with the files issued in win32-release, instability is almost a guarantee but i haven't encountered any big problems in daytime use)
